# What's Spotlight? [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@spotlightjs/spotlight.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spotlightjs/spotlight)

Spotlight is Sentry for Development. Debuggability elevated. Spotlight brings rich observability into development environments by leveraging the power of Sentry's SDKs, giving you real-time insights into errors, performance, and logsâ€”essential for modern development and AI-assisted coding workflows.

## What You Can Do

- View real-time errors, traces, logs, and performance data from your applications
- Monitor multiple projects simultaneously in one place
- Stream and tail events with various output formats (human, logfmt, json, markdown)
- Run commands with automatic Spotlight integration
- Integrate with AI coding assistants via MCP server, giving AI tools direct access to your application's telemetry for smarter debugging and development

## How to Use Spotlight

Spotlight offers two main ways to work with your development telemetry:

**Electron App (macOS)**: Download the standalone desktop application for a native experience.

**CLI** (`npx @spotlightjs/spotlight`): Run the command-line tool with multiple modes:
- Default mode starts a web UI server for viewing telemetry in your browser
- `spotlight tail [types...]` - stream events (errors, traces, logs, attachments) to your terminal with multiple formatters
- `spotlight run <command>` - run your application with Spotlight automatically configured
- `spotlight mcp` - start the MCP server for AI tool integration (stdio + HTTP)

## How It Works

Spotlight uses Sentry SDKs to capture telemetry data and sends it to the Sidecar, a local proxy server running on your machine. The Sidecar processes these events and forwards them to the UI, where you can view everything in real-time via the web interface or stream output to your terminal. Spotlight works standalone or alongside your existing Sentry setup without interference.
