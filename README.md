# What's Spotlight? [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@spotlightjs/spotlight.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spotlightjs/spotlight)

Spotlight is Sentry for Development. Inspired by an old project, Django Debug Toolbar, Spotlight brings a rich debug
overlay into development environments, and it does it by leveraging the existing power of Sentry's SDKs.
