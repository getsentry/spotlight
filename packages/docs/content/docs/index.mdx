# Spotlight UI

Spotlight UI is a component library built on top of shadcn/ui to help you build observability and distributed tracing experiences faster. It provides pre-built components for trace visualization, span trees, and more.

Components are available via the shadcn CLI with our custom registry:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add span-tree -r https://spotlightjs.com/registry.json
```

## Features

- **Trace Visualization** - Display distributed traces with hierarchical span trees
- **Interactive Components** - Click, select, and explore trace data
- **Customizable** - Built with Tailwind CSS and fully customizable
- **shadcn/ui Compatible** - Uses the same design tokens and patterns

## Getting Started

1. **Setup your project** - Make sure you have shadcn/ui set up in your project
2. **Install components** - Use the CLI to add components to your project
3. **Use components** - Import and use components in your application

Check out the [Setup](/docs/setup) guide to get started.
