# Setup

Getting started with Spotlight UI components is straightforward. You can use the shadcn CLI with our custom registry for the fastest setup, or manually copy the component files.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Spotlight UI, make sure your environment meets the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 or later
- A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project (or any React framework)
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) setup in your project

If you don't have shadcn/ui set up, running any install command will set it up for you.

## Installing components

You can install Spotlight UI components using the shadcn CLI with our custom registry:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component> -r https://spotlightjs.com/registry.json
```

For example, to install the SpanTree component:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add span-tree -r https://spotlightjs.com/registry.json
```

The CLI will download the component's code and integrate it into your project's directory (usually under your components folder).

After running the command, you should see a confirmation in your terminal that the files were added. You can then proceed to use the component in your code.

## Manual Installation

If you prefer to manually install components, you can:

1. Copy the component files from the registry
2. Install any required dependencies
3. Update import paths to match your project structure

See each component's documentation page for specific manual installation instructions.

## Next Steps

Once you have components installed, check out the [Usage](/docs/usage) guide to learn how to use them in your application.
