# Setup

Getting started with Spotlight UI components is straightforward. You can use the shadcn CLI with our custom registry for the fastest setup, or manually copy the component files.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Spotlight UI, make sure your environment meets the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 or later
- A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project (or any React framework)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) configured in your project
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) setup in your project (or let the CLI set it up)

### Setting up shadcn/ui

If you don't have shadcn/ui set up yet, you can initialize it first:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init
```

Follow the prompts to configure your project. The CLI will:
- Set up your `components.json` configuration
- Configure path aliases in `tsconfig.json`
- Add the `cn` utility function to `lib/utils.ts`
- Set up CSS variables for theming

## Installing Components

### Using the CLI (Recommended)

The fastest way to add components is using the shadcn CLI with our custom registry:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component> -r https://spotlightjs.com/registry.json
```

For example, to install the SpanTree component:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add span-tree -r https://spotlightjs.com/registry.json
```

The CLI will:
1. Download all component files to your `components/ui` directory
2. Install any required npm dependencies (like `lucide-react`)
3. Add any required CSS styles

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to manually install components:

1. **Install dependencies** - Each component lists its npm dependencies
2. **Copy component files** - Download files from the registry
3. **Add CSS** - Copy any required CSS to your global styles
4. **Update imports** - Adjust import paths to match your project

See each component's documentation page for specific manual installation steps.

## Project Structure

After installing components, your project structure should look like:

```
your-project/
├── components/
│   └── ui/
│       ├── span-tree/
│       │   ├── span-tree.tsx
│       │   ├── span-item.tsx
│       │   ├── span-resizer.tsx
│       │   ├── types.ts
│       │   └── duration.ts
│       └── trace-item/
│           └── ...
├── lib/
│   └── utils.ts          # cn() utility function
└── app/
    └── globals.css       # Global styles including component CSS
```

## Required Utilities

Spotlight UI components use the `cn` utility from shadcn/ui for class merging:

```tsx title="lib/utils.ts"
import { type ClassValue, clsx } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

Make sure this utility is available at `@/lib/utils` (or update component imports accordingly).

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" errors

Make sure your `tsconfig.json` has the correct path aliases:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Components not styled correctly

Ensure you've imported the component CSS in your global stylesheet. Some components (like SpanTree) require specific CSS for the waterfall layout.

### "use client" errors

Spotlight UI components are client components. If you see hydration errors, make sure you're using them within client component boundaries.

## Next Steps

Once you have components installed, check out the [Usage](/docs/usage) guide to learn how to use them in your application.
