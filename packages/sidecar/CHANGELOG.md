# @spotlightjs/sidecar

## 1.11.3

### Patch Changes

- use nanosecond timestamp for captured filenames ([#776](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/776))

- Improve DX by always showing the Spotlight URL, even if the sidecar was already running. Makes it easy to
  cmd/ctrl+click ([#748](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/748)) and open in browser.

## 1.11.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix Astro v5 compatibility ([#706](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/706))

  Upgraded all Astro dependencies to v5+. This required suppressing Sentry instrumentation on the sidecar when used
  programmatically (unless explicitly passed `isStandalone: true`) to prevent Spotlight spamming itself with
  transactions from the very sidecar instance that it is running.

  BREAKING: We had to bump minimum required Astro version for the Astro plugin to 4.7+ as we needed the new dev toolbar
  app APIs.

## 1.11.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix invalid semver range for source-map dependency ([#667](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/667))

## 1.11.0

### Minor Changes

- Add base64 encoding for envelope passing ([#659](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/659))

  This fixes the issue certain characters getting lost or changed during the implicit and forced UTF-8 encoding, namely
  certain ANSI-escape characters when we capture them as breadcrumbs. This was breaking NextJS recently.

  The mechanism is opt-in from Sidecar side and the new overlay automatically opts in to fix the issue. The new overlay
  is also capable of processing messages w/o base64 encoding so this change is both backwards and forwards compatible
  meaning a new version of overlay can work with an old sidecar and a new version of sidecar can work with an older
  overlay. That said to get the fix, both should be on the new version, opting into base64 encoding.

### Patch Changes
