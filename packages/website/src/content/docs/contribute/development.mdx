### Capture data sent to the Sidecar

You can run the Sidecar with `SPOTLIGHT_CAPTURE=1` to write the captured data to a file.
So for example if any Sentry SDK sends an envelope to the Sidecar, it will be written to a file in the current directory looking like this: `application_x_sentry_envelope-1701167447043.txt`.

All these files can be put into `./packages/overlay/_fixtures` and used for testing.
Also, they can be attached to Github issues to reproduce bugs.

### Send sample data to Spotlight

If you run `pnpm sample` in `./packages/overlay` it will send a sample event to the Sidecar and therefore to Spotlight.
All `.txt` files that are contained in `./packages/overlay/_fixtures` will be sent.
This can be very handy when testing Spotlight locally.
