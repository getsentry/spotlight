Spotlight uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to track changes & versions.

Whenever you make a change that is users facing, you should add a changeset to your PR. You can do this by running the
following command:

```shell
pnpm changeset:add
```

This will guide you through the process to define the changeset. You have to select which package(s) are affected by
this change, if it is a patch/minor/major change, and provide a description for the change.

:::note[Versioning]

Spotlight follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/) for versioning. 
When adding the changeset and you mark your PR to require a major bump, please point this out in the PR description. 

:::

Note that not all PRs need a changeset (e.g. if you only write docs), and a PR can also have more than one changeset.
