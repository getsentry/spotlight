description: Use Spotlight with Sentry
---

Spotlight is built that you don't need Sentry to run it. It can contain any kind of integration. However, Sentry is the first integration we've built for Spotlight and it's a **great way to get started**.

If you want your Sentry SDKs to talk to the Sidecar, enable the `spotlight` setting. You don't need a `dsn` for Spotlight to work.
