Spotlight can be utilized in any stack, but in particular is well supported anywhere [Sentry integration](/integrations/sentry/) exists.

There's a few steps to get started:

1. Install and initialize the [Overlay](#1-installation).
2. Run the [Sidecar](#3-run-the-sidecar) concurrently with your development server.
3. Configure [Sentry's SDKs to send to Spotlight](#bonus-leverage-sentry-sdks) by passing `spotlight=True`.

## 1. Installation

Start by installing the `@spotlightjs/spotlight` package in your existing frontend application.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
  ```sh
  npm add @spotlightjs/spotlight
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
  ```sh
  pnpm add @spotlightjs/spotlight
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
  ```sh
  yarn add @spotlightjs/spotlight
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
We're loading Spotlight with production dependencies as the import is static, but the expectation is that it will be tree-shaken out by checking for a development environment.

If you're using a dynamic import, its possible you can simply list this in your `devDependencies` instead.
:::

## 2. Configuration

Inject the Spotlight overlay into your application:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Dynamic Import">
  If your bundler supports it, its recommended to do a dynamic import to aid tree-shaking:

  ```js
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
    import('@spotlightjs/spotlight').then((Spotlight) =>
      Spotlight.init({ injectImmediately: true })
    );
  }
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Vite">
  ```js
  import * as Spotlight from '@spotlightjs/spotlight';

  // only load Spotlight in dev
  if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
    Spotlight.init();
  }
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Other Bundlers">
  ```js
  import * as Spotlight from '@spotlightjs/spotlight';

  // only load Spotlight in dev
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
    Spotlight.init();
  }
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
It's important that your check for the dev environment is actually tree-shaken away at production build time.
We recommend comparing your build bundle size before and after adding the Spotlight overlay.
:::

Upon loading your UI you should now see the Spotlight toolbar in bottom-right corner of your application.

For more options on how to configure Spotlight's UI, see [Configuration](/reference/configuration/).

## 3. Run the Sidecar

Spotlight's [architecture](/architecture/) requires a sidecar to be running alongside your service. This is to enable streaming data collection from your backend services into the Spotlight overlay.

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Vite" href="/sidecar/vite/" />
  <LinkCard title="Webpack" href="/sidecar/webpack/" />
  <LinkCard title="Other" href="/sidecar/npx/" />
</CardGrid>


## Bonus: Leverage Sentry SDKs

To get the most value out of Spotlight, configure Sentry's SDKs. You don't have to use sentry.io but you can use the them to just power Spotlight.

<SentryCodeBlockWeb />

import { Content as SentryCodeBlockMobile } from '../../../components/sentryCodeBlockMobile.mdx';

<SentryCodeBlockMobile />
