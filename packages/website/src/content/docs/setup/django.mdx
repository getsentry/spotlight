This guide gets Spotlight up and running in Django with Sentry SDK.

## 1. Installation

### Install Sentry SDK

Follow the [Django Getting Started](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/django/#install) guide to install and configure Sentry SDK for Python/Django.

Note that you don't need a DSN or don't need to sign up for Sentry to use Spotlight. If you already have Sentry SDK installed, make sure you have v2.25.0 or newer.

### Get and Run Spotlight

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npx">
  ```shell
  npx @spotlightjs/spotlight
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="docker">
  ```shell
  docker run --rm -p 8969 ghcr.io/getsentry/spotlight:latest
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="binary">
  ```shell
  curl -q https://spotlightjs.com/install.sh | sh
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 2. Enable Spotlight

Set `SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT` environment variable to `1`[^1] (see [our docker compose instructions](/sidecar/docker/#docker-compose) if you are using Docker Compose).

That's it! As long as Spotlight is running, and `DEBUG` is set to `True` in your Django settings[^2], our Django integration will automatically inject it into your UI.

### Additional Configuration

If for some reason you do not want Spotlight to inject itself onto the pages, you can set `SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT_MIDDLEWARE` environment variable to `0`.
If you are okay with the injection but want the default Django error page instead of Spotlight, you can set `SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT_ON_ERROR` environment variable to `0` to only disable this part.

[^1]: If, for some reason, you need to run Spotlight on a different port or domain, you can set it here instead of a "truthy" value which would use the default URL (ie. `SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT=http://localhost:3839/stream`).
[^2]: This requirement is to prevent enabling Spotlight accidentally on production environments.
