This guide gets Spotlight up and running in Django with Sentry SDK.

## 1. Installation

### Install Sentry SDK

Follow the [Django Getting Started](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/django/#install) guide to install and configure Sentry SDK for Python/Django.

Note that you don't need a DSN or don't need to sign up for Sentry to use Spotlight. If you already have Sentry SDK installed, make sure you have v2.25.0 or newer.

### Get and Run Spotlight

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npx">
  ```shell
  npx @spotlightjs/spotlight
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="docker">
  ```shell
  docker run --rm -p 8969 ghcr.io/getsentry/spotlight:latest
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="binary">
  ```shell
  curl -q https://spotlightjs.com/install.sh | sh
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 2. Enable Spotlight in your env

Set `$SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT` to `1` in your env

That's it! As long as Spotlight is running, our Django integration will automatically inject it into your UI.
