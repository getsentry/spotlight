This guide gets Spotlight up and running in Magento with Sentry SDK.

## 1. Installation

### Install Sentry SDK

Follow the [Magento Installation](https://github.com/justbetter/magento2-sentry#installation) guide to install and configure the Sentry SDK for Magento.

Note that you don't need a DSN or don't need to sign up for Sentry to use Spotlight. If you already have Sentry SDK installed, make sure you have a recent version.

### Get and Run Spotlight

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npx">```shell npx @spotlightjs/spotlight ```</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="docker">
    ```shell docker run --rm -p 8969 ghcr.io/getsentry/spotlight:latest ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="binary">
    ```shell curl -q https://spotlightjs.com/install.sh | sh ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 2. Enable Spotlight

### Configure Sentry

In your `app/etc/env.php` file, add the spotlight configuration:

```php
'sentry' => [
  ...
  'spotlight' => true
]
```

Or alternatively add the `CONFIG__SENTRY__ENVIRONMENT__SPOTLIGHT` environment variable to environment

```env
CONFIG__SENTRY__ENVIRONMENT__SPOTLIGHT=true
```

That's it! As long as Spotlight is running, and Magento is not running in production mode[^1], the Magento integration will automatically inject Spotlight into your UI.

### Additional Configuration

If you need to run Spotlight on a different port or domain, you can specify a Spotlight URL:

```php
'sentry' => [
  ...
  'spotlight_url' => 'http://localhost:3839/stream'
]
```

or

```env
CONFIG__SENTRY__ENVIRONMENT__SPOTLIGHT_URL=http://localhost:3839/stream
```

[^1]: This requirement is to prevent enabling Spotlight accidentally on production environments.
