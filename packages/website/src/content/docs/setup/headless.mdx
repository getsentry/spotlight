title: Using Spotlight's Electron App
description: Use the overlay in a headless environment

import DownloadButton from '../../../components/DownloadButton.astro';

Spotlight provides an Electron app that can be used to run the Sidecar as well as a dedicated instance of the overlay.

This is most useful for headless environments (like an API service), but is also critical for non-web client applications, such as mobile and desktop apps.

## Installation

Get started by downloading the latest version of the Electron app for your platform.

<DownloadButton>Download for Mac</DownloadButton>

## Usage

In addition to loading the application, make sure you've enabled spotlight in the relevant Sentry SDKs (e.g. via `spotlight: true`):

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___DSN___',
  spotlight: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
  // ...other Sentry options
});
```
