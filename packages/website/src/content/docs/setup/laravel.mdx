This guide gets Spotlight up and running in Laravel with Sentry SDK.

## 1. Installation

### Install Sentry SDK

Follow the [Laravel Getting Started](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/guides/laravel/#install) guide to install and configure Sentry SDK for Laravel.

Note that you don't need a DSN or don't need to sign up for Sentry to use Spotlight. If you already have Sentry SDK installed, make sure you have a recent version.

### Get and Run Spotlight

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npx">```shell npx @spotlightjs/spotlight ```</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="docker">
    ```shell docker run --rm -p 8969 ghcr.io/getsentry/spotlight:latest ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="binary">
    ```shell curl -q https://spotlightjs.com/install.sh | sh ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 2. Enable Spotlight

### Configure Sentry

In your `config/sentry.php` file, uncomment or add the spotlight configuration:

```php
'spotlight' => env('SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT', false),
```

### Set Environment Variable

Add the `SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT` environment variable to your `.env` file:

```env
SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT=true
```

That's it! As long as Spotlight is running, and `APP_DEBUG` is set to `true` in your Laravel application[^1], our Laravel integration will automatically inject Spotlight into your UI.

### Additional Configuration

If for some reason you do not want Spotlight to inject itself onto the pages, you can disable it by setting `SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT=false` in your `.env` file.

If you need to run Spotlight on a different port or domain, you can specify the full URL instead of a boolean value:

```env
SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT=http://localhost:3839/stream
```

[^1]: This requirement is to prevent enabling Spotlight accidentally on production environments.
