Spotlight is a _debug toolbar_ that you can use for quicker development.
It's a small widget injected into your page that surfaces all kinds of different information 
that are relvant to your development process.

It can show you errors, traces, configurations settings, installed dependencies, you name it.
Spotlight is developed with customizablity in mind, so you can add your own integrations to it.
