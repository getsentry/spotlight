The Sidecar uses SSE (Server-Sent Events) to forward events to the Spotlight overlay. It is a standalone server that can be deployed on the same machine as the Spotlight overlay or on a different machine.

It receives `POST` requests on `/stream` from the Sentry SDKs or any other source and forwards them to the Spotlight overlay via SSE.

By default the Sidecar listens on port `8969` and the Spotlight overlay connects to it on `http://localhost:8969/stream`.

The url can be configured via the `sidecar` config variable in the Spotlight overlay see [Configuration](/reference/configuration/#sidecar).

Also in the Sentry SDKs the URL can be configured via the `spotlight` option, for example in the Python SDK:

```python {4}
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    spotlight="http://localhost:8969/stream",
)
```
