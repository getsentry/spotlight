import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Docker

We provide a Docker container which runs the Sidecar (including the overlay).

```shell
docker run --rm \
    --pull always \
    --name spotlight \
    --detach \
    -p 8969:8969/tcp \
    ghcr.io/getsentry/spotlight:latest
```

## Docker Compose

If you're already using Docker Compose, we recommend adding Spotlight to your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  # ...
  spotlight:
    image: ghcr.io/getsentry/spotlight:latest
    restart: on-failure
    pull_policy: always
    ports:
      - "8969:8969"
```

Once you add Spotlight to your `docker-compose.yml`, don't forget to set the spotlight URL in the SDKs to
`http://spotlight:8969/stream`. You can do this by either setting the `spotlight` config setting to this value
or by setting `SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT` env variable to `http://spotlight:8969/stream` for your application[^1].

[^1]: This environment variable is supported by Node, Python, Ruby, and PHP SDKs.
