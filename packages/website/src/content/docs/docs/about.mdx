Spotlight started out as a [Hackweek project](https://syntax.fm/show/666/hackweek-projects-realtime-markdown-editor-and-a-hardware-recording-button) at Sentry:

> Spotlight is Sentry for Development. Inspired by an old project, Django Debug Toolbar, Spotlight brings a rich debug
overlay into development environments, and it does it by leveraging the existing power of Sentry's SDKs

:::note[Historical Context]
The original "overlay" concept has evolved. Spotlight now provides a [Desktop App](/docs/desktop-app/) and [CLI](/docs/cli/) featuring a browser-based UI instead of an embedded overlay. (More context in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/issues/891#issue-3302059597).)
:::

You get the power of Sentry's telemetry (through its SDKs) without needing Sentry's production monitoring. If you already use Sentry, that's great. All you need is enabling Spotlight in your SDK and run Spotlight locally. If you are not using Sentry, you need to install the free and open source Sentry SDKs to get started. If you want to use Sentry later on, this saves you the initial setup. Just add your Sentry DSNs into your projects and off you go!

## Three Ways to Use Spotlight

Spotlight provides three powerful tools for debugging and development:

### 1. Local Development Tool

A real-time debugging UI that displays errors, traces, logs, and profiles in the Desktop App or browser. See everything happening in your application as it happens.

**Perfect for:**
- Visual debugging during development
- Inspecting distributed traces
- Monitoring application performance
- Viewing real-time logs and errors

### 2. MCP Server

Model Context Protocol integration that connects Spotlight to AI coding assistants like Cursor, Claude, and other MCP clients. Your AI assistant can access your application's runtime data to help debug issues.

**Perfect for:**
- AI-assisted debugging
- Letting your coding assistant analyze errors
- Getting context-aware code suggestions based on runtime data
- Automated error investigation

### 3. CLI (Command Line Interface)

Run your applications with Spotlight's CLI to automatically capture telemetry data, or tail events in real-time from your terminal.

**Perfect for:**
- Running backend services with automatic instrumentation
- Streaming logs and traces to your terminal
- CI/CD integration
- Headless environments

## Why Spotlight?

Spotlight provides comprehensive debugging visibility:

- **Errors** with full stack traces
- **Traces** including distributed transactions
- **Logs** with structured data
- **Profiling data** for performance analysis
- **Configuration** and dependency information
- **Customizable** with your own integrations

### Spotlight vs Sentry

|  | Spotlight | Sentry |
|---|---|---|
| **Where it runs** | Local on your machine | Cloud or self-hosted |
| **Data display** | Real-time, shows everything | Aggregated, sampled |
| **Cost** | Free and open source | Commercial (with free tier) |
| **Use case** | Active development | Production monitoring |

## Quick Start

If you are already using Sentry SDKs in your application try the following:

1. Set `SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT=1` in your env[^1]
2. Run `npx @spotlightjs/spotlight`[^2]
3. Run your application
4. Go to [http://localhost:8969](http://localhost:8969)
5. Observe the traces and errors coming to your local Spotlight instance

[^1]: Currently Python, Ruby, PHP, and all JS-based SDKs support this env variable. If your choice of SDK doesn't support it, you can still use Spotlight by enabling the `spotlight` option in its init configuration. Also you can let us know of your interest and we'll add support for the env variable.
[^2]: If you don't have `npx` around, you can use `docker run -p 8969:8969 ghcr.io/getsentry/spotlight:latest`, download a binary from our [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/releases/latest), or if you don't mind piping to shell: `curl -sL https://spotlightjs.com/install.sh | sh`. Alternatively, we provide a [Desktop App](/docs/desktop-app/) that bundles everything together. <DownloadButton>Download for Mac</DownloadButton>
