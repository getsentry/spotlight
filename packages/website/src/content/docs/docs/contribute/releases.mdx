description: How-to publish a new release of Spotlight.
---

When you want to publish a new version, you need to trigger the
[Prepare Publish](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/actions/workflows/prepare-publish.yml) Github Action. This
action will open a PR with all versions bumped & changelogs updated according to the currently pending changesets. If
you approve & merge this PR, these versions will automatically be published to NPM.
