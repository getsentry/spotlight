description: How-to publish a new release of Spotlight.
---

Spotlight uses [Craft](https://github.com/getsentry/craft) for release management. Craft automatically determines version bumps from conventional commits and generates changelogs.

## Release Workflow

### 1. Trigger the Release

Go to the [Release](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/actions/workflows/release.yml) GitHub Action and click "Run workflow".

You can specify:

- **Version**: Leave as `auto` to determine from commits, or specify `major`, `minor`, `patch`, or an explicit version like `4.10.0`
- **Force**: Check this to release even if there are release-blockers

### 2. Review the Release Branch

Craft creates a release branch (e.g., `release/4.10.0`) with:

- Updated version in `packages/spotlight/package.json`
- Generated changelog in `packages/spotlight/CHANGELOG.md`

The CI will build and test this branch automatically.

### 3. Merge and Publish

Once the release branch CI passes:

1. Review the changelog and version bump
2. Merge the release branch to `main`
3. The publish workflow triggers automatically and:
   - Publishes to NPM
   - Creates a GitHub release with binaries
   - Tags the Docker image as `latest`
   - Builds and signs the Electron app

## Version Determination

Craft analyzes commits since the last release to determine the version bump:

| Commit Type | Example | Version Bump |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Breaking change | `feat!: remove API` | Major (1.0.0 → 2.0.0) |
| New feature | `feat: add dark mode` | Minor (1.0.0 → 1.1.0) |
| Bug fix | `fix: handle error` | Patch (1.0.0 → 1.0.1) |

## Manual Publishing

If you need to manually trigger a publish (e.g., to re-publish a specific target):

1. Go to the [Publish](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/actions/workflows/publish.yml) workflow
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter the version and select which targets to publish

## Targets

| Target | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm` | Publishes `@spotlightjs/spotlight` to NPM registry |
| `docker` | Tags Docker image as `latest` and version tag |
| `electron` | Builds, signs, and uploads macOS Electron app |
