Pull down the repo (or your fork):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight.git
```

Spotlight relies on a [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) monorepo. You'll need to install pnpm to get things going, which can be done with [Volta](https://volta.sh).

:::note[Volta & PNPM]

Make sure you [enable `pnpm` support for `Volta`](https://docs.volta.sh/advanced/pnpm):

```shell
# Add this to your profile file or startup script
export VOLTA_FEATURE_PNPM=1
```

:::

Ensure the node and pnpm are available:

```shell
volta install node pnpm
```

Install the package requirements:

```shell
pnpm install
```

And finally, run an initial build:

```shell
pnpm build
```

## Development

Depending on what you're doing there's two paths to develop against Spotlight.

### With existing data

If you just want to test things out with some example traces and errors you can spin up the Spotlight repo into watch mode:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

Send sample fixtures to the sidecar with:

```shell
pnpm run --filter @spotlightjs/spotlight sample
```

This will send all the sample data to Spotlight. You can also pick a specific file and pass that as an argument to the script instead:

```shell
pnpm run --filter @spotlightjs/spotlight sample envelope_php_error.txt
```

### Linking against an existing project

Additionally you may want to link it into an existing project. This is a little brittle, and we're not experts here, so your mileage may vary.

{/* TODO: Can we just link @spotlightjs/spotlight? Probably?? */}

First, when in the Spotlight root directory, you'll need to link the packages you're referencing (likely `@spotlightjs/spotlight`):

```shell
pnpm link --global -C packages/spotlight
```

You can now link these within your project. For example if you're using `pnpm`:

```shell
pnpm link --global @spotlightjs/spotlight
```

## Repository Structure

The monorepo is mostly straight forward, but here's a quick summary:

```
spotlight
└── packages
    ├── spotlight    // @spotlightjs/spotlight - main package (UI, sidecar, CLI, Electron app)
    └── website      // @spotlightjs/website   - documentation website
```
