### Capture data sent to the Sidecar

You can run the Sidecar with `SPOTLIGHT_CAPTURE=1` to write the captured data to a file.
So for example if any Sentry SDK sends an envelope to the Sidecar, it will be written to a file in the current directory looking like this: `application_x_sentry_envelope-1701167447043.txt`.

All these files can be put into `./packages/spotlight/_fixtures` and used for testing.
Also, they can be attached to Github issues to reproduce bugs.

### Send sample data to Spotlight

If you run `pnpm sample` in `./packages/spotlight` it will send a sample event to the Sidecar and therefore to Spotlight.
All `.txt` files that are contained in `./packages/spotlight/_fixtures` will be sent.
This can be very handy when testing Spotlight locally.

### Browser Debug Console

To get detailed browser console logs for debugging, open the following URL in your browser while the Sidecar is running:

- [`http://localhost:8969/#spotlight-debug`](http://localhost:8969/#spotlight-debug)

This will enable advanced debug output in the browser console.  
> **Tip:** This is especially useful for inspecting Sidecar behavior.

### Inspect Sidecar Stream

You can directly inspect the raw envelopes received by the Sidecar using `curl`:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8969/stream -H 'Accept: text/event-stream' --verbose
```

This command will stream the envelopes as they arrive, allowing you to verify what data is being processed by the Sidecar in real time.
