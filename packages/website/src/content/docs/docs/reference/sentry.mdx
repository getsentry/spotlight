description: Interface of SentryIntegration

The Sentry integration is the default in Spotlight. It receives events and envelope formats from Sentry SDKs (when configured with `spotlight=true`) and renders those as Errors and Traces in the overlay.

```ts
import { init, sentry } from "@spotlightjs/spotlight";

init({
  integrations: [sentry()],
});
```

Additionally it includes an event to trigger synchronously rendering an error:

```js
import { trigger } as Spotlight from '@spotlightjs/spotlight';

trigger("sentry:showError", {
  eventId: string,
  event?: Event,
});
```
