The Spotlight Desktop App is a standalone application that combines the sidecar server and debugging UI in a single package. Perfect for when you want a dedicated debugging environment.

## Why Use the Desktop App?

The desktop app offers several advantages:

- **All-in-one solution**: Sidecar server and UI bundled together
- **No browser required**: Dedicated window for debugging
- **Persistent workspace**: Stays open across browser refreshes
- **Auto-updates**: Always get the latest features
- **Clean separation**: Keep debugging separate from your development browser

**Perfect for:**
- Headless or mobile development
- When you want debugging in a separate window
- Team members who prefer desktop apps
- Quick setup without browser configuration

## Download and Installation

Get started by downloading the latest version for your platform:

<DownloadButton>Download for Mac</DownloadButton>

:::note[Other Platforms]
Currently, the desktop app is available for macOS. Windows and Linux support is coming soon.

In the meantime, you can use the [CLI](/docs/cli/) or [browser-based UI](/docs/sidecar/npx/).

### Installation Steps

1. **Download** the app using the button above
2. **Open** the downloaded `.dmg` file
3. **Drag** Spotlight to your Applications folder
4. **Launch** Spotlight from Applications

## What's Included

The desktop app provides everything you need for local debugging:

### Built-in Sidecar Server

The app automatically starts a Spotlight sidecar server:

- Default port: 8969 (configurable in settings)
- No need to run separate commands
- Just launch the app and you're ready

### Debugging UI

Access all Spotlight features through the dedicated interface:

- **Errors Tab**: View runtime errors with full stack traces
- **Traces Tab**: Inspect performance traces and spans
- **Logs Tab**: Browse application logs with filtering
- **Profiles Tab**: Analyze performance profiles
- **Settings**: Configure sidecar and UI preferences

### Auto-Updates

The app keeps itself up to date:

- Automatically checks for updates
- Downloads and installs in the background
- Ensures you always have the latest features and bug fixes

## Setup Your Application

Once the desktop app is running, configure your application to send telemetry to Spotlight:

### Backend Applications (Node.js, Python, etc.)

Set the `SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT` environment variable:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Node.js">
    ```javascript
    // Sentry will automatically use SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT env var
    import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node';

    Sentry.init({
      dsn: 'your-dsn', // Optional for local dev
      // No spotlight config needed - handled by env var
    });
    ```

    Run your app:
    ```bash
    SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT=1 node server.js
    # or
    export SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT=1
    npm run dev
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Python">
    ```python
    # Sentry will automatically use SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT env var
    import sentry_sdk

    sentry_sdk.init(
        dsn="your-dsn",  # Optional for local dev
        # No spotlight config needed - handled by env var
    )
    ```

    Run your app:
    ```bash
    SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT=1 python app.py
    # or
    export SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT=1
    flask run
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Other Languages">
    Most Sentry SDKs support the `SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT` environment variable:

    ```bash
    SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT=1 ./your-app
    # or
    export SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT=1
    ./your-app
    ```

    Check your SDK's documentation for Spotlight support.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Frontend Applications

For browser-based applications, add the Spotlight browser integration:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'your-dsn', // Optional for local dev
  integrations: [
    Sentry.spotlightBrowserIntegration()
  ],
  // Only enable in development
  enabled: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
});
```

## Using the Desktop App

### Starting the App

1. Launch Spotlight from your Applications folder
2. The sidecar server starts automatically on port 8969
3. The debugging UI opens in the app window

### Viewing Events

As your application sends telemetry to Spotlight:

1. **Errors appear in real-time** in the Errors tab
2. **Traces are displayed** with timing information
3. **Logs stream** to the Logs tab
4. **Profiles** show up when captured

### Filtering and Searching

Use the built-in filters to find what you need:

- **Search by text**: Find errors or logs containing specific text
- **Filter by type**: Show only errors, traces, or logs
- **Time range**: Focus on specific time periods
- **Source filter**: Show events from specific files or components

### Inspecting Details

Click any event to see full details:

- **Errors**: Complete stack traces, context, and breadcrumbs
- **Traces**: Full span tree with timing breakdown
- **Logs**: Structured log data with attributes
- **Profiles**: Flamegraphs and performance metrics

### Clearing Events

Use the clear button in the toolbar to remove all events and start fresh.

## Configuration

### Changing the Port

If port 8969 is already in use:

1. Open Spotlight **Settings** (via menu or gear icon)
2. Change the **Sidecar Port** setting
3. Restart the app
4. Update your app's SDK configuration to match

### UI Preferences

Customize the interface:

- **Theme**: Choose light or dark mode
- **Font size**: Adjust for readability
- **Panel layout**: Configure which panels are visible

## When to Use Desktop App vs CLI vs Browser

Choose the right tool for your workflow:

### Use Desktop App When:
- ✅ You want a dedicated debugging window
- ✅ You prefer desktop applications
- ✅ You're developing headless or mobile apps
- ✅ You want automatic updates

### Use CLI When:
- ✅ You prefer terminal-based workflows
- ✅ You need to stream events to files
- ✅ You're automating with scripts
- ✅ You want machine-readable output

### Use Browser UI When:
- ✅ You want overlay on your application
- ✅ You're debugging frontend web apps
- ✅ You want integrated developer experience

## Use Cases

### Mobile Development

When developing mobile apps, the desktop app provides a great debugging companion:

1. Run the desktop app on your machine
2. Configure your mobile app's SDK to point to your machine's IP:
   ```
   spotlight: "http://192.168.1.100:8969/stream"
   ```
3. Run your mobile app on device/simulator
4. View events in the desktop app

### Backend Development

For backend services without a browser:

1. Start the desktop app
2. Run your backend with `SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT=1`
3. Make API requests to your service
4. See traces and errors in the desktop app

### Microservices

Debug multiple services simultaneously:

1. Start the desktop app (single sidecar on port 8969)
2. Point all services to the same sidecar
3. See events from all services in one place
4. Filter by service or component

### Team Collaboration

Share debugging sessions:

1. One team member runs the desktop app
2. Others can view the UI via browser at `http://localhost:8969`
3. Or export events for sharing

## Troubleshooting

### App Won't Start

**macOS Security Warning:**

If you see "Spotlight can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer":

1. Right-click the app and select "Open"
2. Click "Open" in the security dialog
3. macOS will remember this choice

**Port Already in Use:**

If you see a port conflict:
1. Change the port in Settings
2. Or close other applications using port 8969

### No Events Showing

**Check SDK Configuration:**
1. Verify Sentry SDK is initialized in your app
2. Ensure `spotlight` integration is enabled
3. Check environment variable is set: `SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT=1`

**Check Network:**
1. Verify your app can reach `localhost:8969`
2. Check firewall settings if needed

**Enable Debug:**
1. In your app, enable Sentry debug mode
2. Check console for Spotlight connection messages

### Events Not Updating

**Refresh the View:**
- Click the refresh button or use Cmd+R

**Clear and Restart:**
1. Clear events
2. Restart your application
3. Trigger new events

## Privacy and Security

### Local-Only

The desktop app and sidecar run entirely on your local machine:

- **No data sent to external servers** - Everything stays local
- **No telemetry collected** - The app doesn't track your usage
- **Memory-only storage** - Events are cleared when the app closes

### Development Only

Spotlight is designed exclusively for development:

- **Never enable in production** - Use environment checks to restrict to development only
- **Guard sensitive data** - Keep production secrets out of test scenarios
- **Review before sharing** - Be mindful when sharing screenshots or logs
