### Description

At a high level, Spotlight consists of two components:

1. A standalone UI (`@spotlightjs/overlay`) that runs independently in your browser or as a desktop application. The UI is a React application that displays your application's telemetry data in real-time.

2. A proxy server (`@spotlightjs/sidecar`) which receives telemetry from your application and streams it to the UI. This is achieved via a simple HTTP relay, allowing SDKs to push events to it, and allowing the UI to receive events using [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events).

For convenience, these packages are combined in a single package (`@spotlightjs/spotlight`), which is the recommended way to run Spotlight.
This means that adoption in most projects is as simple as:

```shell
# Run the Spotlight sidecar with UI
npx @spotlightjs/spotlight

# Or install globally
npm install -g @spotlightjs/spotlight
spotlight
```

Enabling Spotlight in your application's SDK:

```typescript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node';

// Enable Spotlight for development
Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'your-dsn',
  spotlight: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
});
```

Or simply set the environment variable:

```shell
export SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT=1
```

You can send any kind of events to the Sidecar, it forwards them to the Spotlight UI where integrations process and display the data.

Spotlight by default has a Sentry integration, if you are using a Sentry SDK and enable the Spotlight connection (only required on the Server), Spotlight is able
to render Traces/Errors and more in your frontend.
