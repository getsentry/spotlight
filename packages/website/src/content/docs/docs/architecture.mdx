## How It Works

Spotlight consists of two components bundled in `@spotlightjs/spotlight`:

1. **Sidecar Server** - A local HTTP server that receives telemetry from your application and streams it to connected clients using [Server-Sent Events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events).

2. **UI** - A React application that displays telemetry data in real-time. Available as a [Desktop App](/docs/desktop-app/) or browser-based UI at `localhost:8969`.

## Data Flow

```
Your App → Sentry SDK → Sidecar (port 8969) → UI
                              ↓
                        [In-memory store]
                              ↓
                    Desktop App / Browser / MCP
```

1. Your application sends telemetry via Sentry SDK
2. Sidecar receives and stores events in memory
3. Connected clients (UI, MCP) receive events via SSE
4. Events are displayed in real-time

## Multiple Clients

A single sidecar can serve multiple clients simultaneously:
- **Desktop App** - Dedicated window with built-in UI
- **Browser** - Web UI at `http://localhost:8969`
- **CLI** - Stream events to terminal with `spotlight tail`
- **MCP** - AI assistants query events via Model Context Protocol
