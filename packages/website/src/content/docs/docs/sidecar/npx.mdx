import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

To run Sidecar independently with NPX, run the following command:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm and yarn">
    ```sh
    npx @spotlightjs/spotlight
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```sh
    pnpx @spotlightjs/spotlight
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


This starts the server on port `8969`.

### Built in Overlay

If you start the sidecar independently, you can visit the overlay at `http://localhost:8969/` and use a built in overlay to view your application.
