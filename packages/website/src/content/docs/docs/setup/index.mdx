Spotlight provides an Electron app that can be used to run the Sidecar as well as a dedicated instance of the overlay.

## Installation

Get started by downloading the latest version of the Electron app for your platform.

<DownloadButton>Download for Mac</DownloadButton>

### Other ways

If Electron apps are not your thing or you are not using a Mac we have some more ways to run Spotlight with it's web UI:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npx">
  ```shell
  npx @spotlightjs/spotlight
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="docker">
  ```shell
  docker run --rm -p 8969 ghcr.io/getsentry/spotlight:latest
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="binary">
  ```shell
  curl -q https://spotlightjs.com/install.sh | sh
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## SDK Setup

In addition to loading the application, make sure you've enabled spotlight in the relevant Sentry SDKs (e.g. via `spotlight: true`):

For front-end applications, you need to enable the `browserTracingIntegration` for tracing to work. This is to only include this bit of the code for the users of Spotlight:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___DSN___',
  integrations: [Sentry.browserTracingIntegration()],
  // ...other Sentry options
});
```
