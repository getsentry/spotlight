Spotlight offers several ways to run depending on your workflow and preferences. All options provide the same core debugging capabilities. Choose the one that fits best.

## Three Ways to Run Spotlight
:::tip[Combine Options]
You can use multiple options together. For example, run the Desktop App for visual debugging while also connecting Cursor via MCP for AI-assisted debugging.
:::
| Option | Best For | Platform | UI |
|--------|----------|----------|-----|
| **Desktop App** | Visual debugging in a dedicated window | All platforms | Built-in |
| **CLI** | Terminal workflows, wrapping apps, automation | All platforms | Browser |
| **MCP Server** | AI-assisted debugging with Cursor, Claude, etc. | All platforms | none |

## Next Steps

After choosing your setup method, you may need to configure your application's Sentry SDK:

Most SDKs automatically detect the `SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT` environment variable—just set it to `1` or the sidecar URL.
