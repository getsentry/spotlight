Spotlight brings the power of Sentry into your local development environment. This guide will help you set up everything you need to start debugging with Spotlight.

## Step 1: Install Sentry SDK

Follow your language or framework setup to install Sentry's SDK here: [https://docs.sentry.io/](https://docs.sentry.io/). Follow Sentry docs and enable logs and set tracing sample rate to 1.

**Come back here after you've installed the Sentry SDK.**

## Step 2: Install Spotlight

Choose the method that works best for your workflow:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Quick Start (npx)">
    The fastest way to get started:

    ```bash
    npx @spotlightjs/spotlight
    ```

    This starts Spotlight on `http://localhost:8969` where you can access the web UI.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Desktop App">
    Download the Spotlight desktop application for the best experience:

    <DownloadButton>Download for Mac</DownloadButton>

    The desktop app includes:
    - Dedicated window for debugging
    - System tray integration
    - Automatic updates
    - Better performance
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="CLI (Global Install)">
    Install the Spotlight CLI globally:

    ```bash
    npm install -g @spotlightjs/spotlight
    ```

    Then run:

    ```bash
    spotlight
    ```

    The CLI provides additional commands for streaming events and running applications.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Docker">
    Run Spotlight in a container:

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -p 8969:8969 ghcr.io/getsentry/spotlight:latest
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Configure Your SDK

Now configure your Sentry SDK to send data to Spotlight. The exact configuration depends on your framework, but here's the pattern:

### Frontend Applications

For browser-based applications, enable the Spotlight browser integration:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "https://spotlight@local/0", // Placeholder DSN

  // Enable Spotlight integration and comprehensive logging
  integrations: [
    Sentry.spotlightBrowserIntegration(),
    Sentry.captureConsoleIntegration({
      levels: ['log', 'info', 'warn', 'error', 'debug'],
    }),
  ],

  // Capture 100% of transactions locally
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

### Backend Applications

For Node.js and other backend applications:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "https://spotlight@local/0", // Placeholder DSN

  // Capture 100% of transactions locally
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

### Environment Variable

:::note[When you don't need this]
If you are using `spotlight run` to start Spotlight, you don't need to add this environment variable as we take care of it for you.
:::

You need to set the `SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT` environment variable to `1` to enable Spotlight if you're using `spotlight tail`, our UI or the MCP server.

```bash
# In your .env.local or .env file
SENTRY_SPOTLIGHT=1
```

## Step 4: Verify Your Setup

1. **Ensure Spotlight is running** (you should see the UI at http://localhost:8969)

2. **Start your application** in development mode

3. **Create a test error** to verify everything works:

   ```javascript
   // Add this temporary code to trigger a test error
   setTimeout(() => {
     throw new Error("Test error for Spotlight!");
   }, 1000);
   ```

4. **Check the Spotlight UI** - you should see:
   - The error in the Errors tab
   - A trace showing the error context
   - Console logs in the Logs tab

🎉 **Success!** You're now capturing local telemetry with Spotlight.

## Next Steps

Now that Spotlight is running, explore its powerful features:

- [CLI](/docs/cli/) - Run apps with automatic instrumentation, stream events, and tail logs in real-time
- [MCP Server](/docs/mcp/) - Connect Spotlight to AI assistants like Cursor and Claude for AI-powered debugging assistance
- [Desktop App](/docs/desktop-app/) - Enhanced debugging experience with dedicated window, system integration, and better performance
