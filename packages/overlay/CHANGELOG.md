# @spotlightjs/core

## 2.14.1

### Patch Changes

- Fixes a race condition where we try to graft a trace which was a skeleton generated from a trace context rather than a
  ([#783](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/783)) full trace. This was causing profile frames not getting
  grafted as the start_timestamp and timestamp values were not set correctly.

## 2.14.0

### Minor Changes

- feat: Keep profile spans collapsed ([#737](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/737))

- Swap "Errors" and "Explore" tab places, making "Explore" the default. It makes more sense this way as there is almost
  ([#758](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/758)) guaranteed to have traces in a good setup but not really
  errors.

- Restructured Sentry integration tabs and components ([#765](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/765))

- - #731: Search Bar sticky and fixed overflow across the overlay.
    ([#740](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/740))

- Include filter functionality when searching spans ([#747](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/747))

### Patch Changes

- Fixed parsing of envelope data. ([#751](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/751))

- fix: Null-check sentryClient.\_options ([#736](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/736))

- format node internals correctly in stacktrace ([#739](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/739))

- Fixed #738 ([#741](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/741))

## 2.13.0

### Minor Changes

  ([#729](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/729))

- Added Search support in Trace details ([#730](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/730))

### Patch Changes

- Fix envelope sorting and local classification ([#727](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/727))

- Fix UI issues when we get a bare span envelope ([#726](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/726))

- Fix span details modal resetting trace view tree state on close (for reals this time)
  ([#728](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/728))

- Fixes detection of Sentry SDK frames in Vite projects ([#718](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/718))

## 2.12.1

### Patch Changes

- Process profiles without thread metadata correctly ([#714](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/714))

## 2.12.0

### Minor Changes

- # Add profile grafting into traces ([#692](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/692))

  With this change, Spotlight can now ingest v1 profiles and graft profiling data into the trace view to fill in the
  gaps where span/trace instrumentation falls short.

  This feature is experimental.

  Breaking change for `tsconfig`: It now targets ES2023 as we needed `Array.findLastIndex()`

- Flatter tree view for deeply nested traces with 1 child at each level
  ([#686](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/686))

### Patch Changes

- Sort envelopes from most recent to oldest ([#697](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/697))

- Fix some typing issues in sentryDataCache ([#691](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/691))

- Fix span details modal resetting trace view tree state on close
  ([#701](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/701))

- Fix some profile samples were not grouped and added to trace span list for detail view
  ([#698](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/698))

- Fix span details showing incorrect span start time ([#689](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/689))

- Fix rare error when `score.total` is missing from `measurements`
  ([#682](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/682))

- Fix Astro v5 compatibility ([#706](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/706))

  Upgraded all Astro dependencies to v5+. This required suppressing Sentry instrumentation on the sidecar when used
  programmatically (unless explicitly passed `isStandalone: true`) to prevent Spotlight spamming itself with
  transactions from the very sidecar instance that it is running.

  BREAKING: We had to bump minimum required Astro version for the Astro plugin to 4.7+ as we needed the new dev toolbar
  app APIs.

- Make things snappy by using Map() for trace span look ups ([#690](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/690))

- Better auto collapsing logic for large or deep span trees ([#699](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/699))

- Unify and simplify duration calculations and representations ([#688](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/688))

## 2.11.1

### Patch Changes

- Ensure queries from all db ops are shown ([#677](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/677))

## 2.11.0

### Minor Changes

- Add more platform icons and some browser icons ([#670](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/670))

## 2.10.1

### Patch Changes

- fix: Always try to use sidecar along with direct SDK transport
  ([#672](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/672))

## 2.10.0

### Minor Changes

- Render placeholders when missing known attributes in Sentry events
  ([#656](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/656))

- Add base64 encoding for envelope passing ([#659](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/659))

  This fixes the issue certain characters getting lost or changed during the implicit and forced UTF-8 encoding, namely
  certain ANSI-escape characters when we capture them as breadcrumbs. This was breaking NextJS recently.

  The mechanism is opt-in from Sidecar side and the new overlay automatically opts in to fix the issue. The new overlay
  is also capable of processing messages w/o base64 encoding so this change is both backwards and forwards compatible
  meaning a new version of overlay can work with an old sidecar and a new version of sidecar can work with an older
  overlay. That said to get the fix, both should be on the new version, opting into base64 encoding.

### Patch Changes

- Fix direct transport init when sidecar transport is already enabled
  ([#658](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/658))

- Add auto-reload dev mode for Overlay ([#657](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight/pull/657))

  The Spotlight UI (overlay) was updated to version 2 to ensure compatibility with version 8 of Sentry's JavaScript
  SDKs.

    version `8` or `>=7.99.0` of your `@sentry/<sdk>` SDK. Older v7 versions will not work correctly anymore.
  - Good news: There are **no public API** changes! You don't need to make any changes to your code.
