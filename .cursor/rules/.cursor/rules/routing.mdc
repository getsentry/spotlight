## Routing
Use React Router v6 (with MemoryRouter) for all routing logic.

Details:
	•	Use <Routes> and <Route> to define all navigable views.
	•	Use <Link> or useNavigate for navigation — do not manually manage routing state like selectedTrace or similar in local component state.
	•	When possible, extract state from the URL using useParams or useSearchParams instead of passing props or using global state.
	•	Treat the URL as the source of truth for navigation-related state (e.g. selected items, tabs, filters, etc).

Examples of routing: [TraceItem.tsx](mdc:packages/overlay/src/integrations/sentry/components/traces/TraceItem.tsx) [index.tsx](mdc:packages/overlay/src/integrations/sentry/components/traces/TraceDetails/index.tsx)
